My mom has gotten him to do some work as a subcontractor/freelancer on her client projects here and there (video editing and motion graphics), but otherwise he hasn't applied for a job for over a",1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/1e61phu/35_year_old_brother_has_been_addicted_to_video/
Isn't gaming bad even if you are a successful streamer or esportler?,2024-07-18 05:56:21,"I'm a 18 yo male and I'm basically in the middle of turning my life around and finding myself. I told myself that I won't play videogames again if it won't be on twitch or youtube or on a big flatscreen in a penthouse with my future girlfriend or homies (even then rarely). But if you think about it, isn't even streaming videogames a bad thing, even if you make tons of money? The people that are watching you are basically wasting their time. You could compare it to selling cigarettes. You become rich at the cost of others health.",4,0.83,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/1e5xoyz/isnt_gaming_bad_even_if_you_are_a_successful/
